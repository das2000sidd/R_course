# R basics

1. Create a vector `x` with the following entries:
```
 3 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 1 1 5 3 1 1 1 2 4 5 5 3
``` 
2. Check which elements of `x` are equal to 1 (Hint: use "==" operator). 
3. Create a variable (e.g vector) `y` having the logarithm of `x`. 
4. Create a vector `z` containing the first five elements of `x`.
5. Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20 in steps of 0.2 (see help `seq` function). 
6. Concatenate `x` and `y` into a vector called `newVec`.
7. Display all objects in the workspace and then remove `newVec` object.
8. Create a `data.frame` called `elasticband` having these two variables.
```
stretch <- c(46,54,48,50,44,42,52)
distance <- c(148,182,173,166,109,141,166)
```
9. Compute the mean of the variable `stretch` from the `elasticbanc` object (Hint: use "$").
10. Which is the class of the variable `distance`?



# Descriptive analyses

1. Load the `Orange` datasets from package `datasets`.
2. Investigate the meaning of the variables (use `help` function).
3. Describe the type of variables included in this `data.frame`.
4. Get a summary of all variables.
5. Compute the correlation between `age` and `circumference`.
6. Compute the mean age of each tree (variable `Tree`).
7. The file `multicentric.txt` contains the data of a multicentric case/control study to discover risk factors of cervical cancer. Import the data in an object called `multi`.
8. How many samples and variable are in this database?
9. Describe the types of variables you have.
10. The file `multicentric.htm` contains a description of the variables. Create a table describing the number of cases and controls (variable `status`) of each country (variable `pais`) included in the study.
11. Create the same table between cases and controls and human papillomavirus (variable 'vph'). Do you think that those variables are associated?
12. Summarize the duration consuming oral contraceptives (variable `durco`) in cases and controls, in each country, educative level (variable `niveledu`).
